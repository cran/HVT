# 1. Abstract

The HVT package offers a suite of R functions designed to construct <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/1-84628-118-0_7" target="_blank">topology preserving maps</a> for in-depth analysis of multivariate data. It is particularly well-suited for datasets with numerous records. The package organizes the typical workflow into several key stages:

1.  **Data Compression**: Long datasets are compressed using Hierarchical Vector Quantization (HVQ) to achieve the desired level of data reduction.

2.  **Data Projection**:  Compressed cells are projected into one and two dimensions using dimensionality reduction algorithms, producing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding" target="_blank">embeddings</a> that preserve the original topology. This allows for intuitive visualization of complex data structures.

3.  **Tessellation**: Voronoi tessellation partitions the projected space into distinct cells, supporting hierarchical visualizations. Heatmaps and interactive plots facilitate exploration and insights into the underlying data patterns.

4.  **Scoring**: Test dataset is evaluated against previously generated maps, enabling their placement within the existing structure. Sequential application across multiple maps is supported if required.

5. **Temporal Analysis and Visualization**: Functions in this stage examine time-series data to identify patterns, estimate transition probabilities, and visualize data flow over time.

6. **Dynamic Forecasting**:  Monte Carlo simulations of Markov chain provides forecasting capabilities for both ex-post and ex-ante scenarios with meticulously handling problematic states when found.



The HVT package allows creation of visually stunning tessellations, showcasing the power of topology preserving maps. Below is an image depicting a captivating tessellation of a torus, see <a href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/Mu-Sigma/HVT/master/vignettes/HVT_vignette.html" target="_blank">**vignette**</a> for more details.

**Features**

1. **Implementation of t-SNE and UMAP in `trainHVT`**: This update incorporates dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE and UMAP in the `trainHVT` function, complementing the existing Sammon's projection. It also enables the visualization of these techniques across all hierarchical levels within the HVT framework.

2. **Implementation of dimensionality reduction evaluation metrics**: This update introduces highly effective dimensionality reduction evaluation metrics as part of the output list of the `trainHVT` function. These metrics are organized into two levels: Level 1 (L1) and Level 2 (L2). The L1 metrics address key areas of dimensionality reduction which are mentioned below, by ensuring comprehensive evaluation and performance.

- Structure Preservation Metrics 
- Distance Preservation Metrics
- Human Centered Metrics
- Interpretive Quality Metrics

## HVT (v23.11.02) {-}

17th November, 2023


This version of the HVT package offers functionality to score cells with layers based on a sequence of maps created using `scoreLayeredHVT`. Given below are the steps to create the successive set of maps.

1. **Map A** - The output of `trainHVT` function which is trained on parent data.

2. **Map B** - The output of `trainHVT` function which is trained on the 'data with novelty' created from `removeNovelty` function.

3. **Map C** - The output of `trainHVT` function which is trained on the 'data without novelty' created from `removeNovelty` function.

The `scoreLayeredHVT` function uses these three maps to score the test datapoints.

Let us try to understand the steps with the help of the diagram below

```{r mlayer_flow,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,fig.show='hold',message=FALSE,fig.cap='Figure 2: Data Segregation for scoring based on a sequence of maps using scoreLayeredHVT()'}
knitr::include_graphics('./pngs/scoreLayeredHVT_function.png')
```

## HVT (v22.12.06) {-}

06th December, 2022

This version of the HVT package offers features for both training an HVT model and eliminating outlier cells from the trained model.

1. **Training or Compression:** The initial step entails training the parent data using the `trainHVT` function, specifying the desired compression percentage and quantization error.

2. **Remove novelty cells:** Following the training process, outlier cells can be identified manually from the 2D hvt plot. These outlier cells can then be inputted into the `removeNovelty` function, which subsequently produces two datasets in its output: one containing 'data with novelty' and the other containing 'data without novelty'.
